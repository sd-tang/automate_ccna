This exercise is to write a script that telnet to multiple switches to configure
its VLAN. It will utilize the python telnetlib.

To start the lab build the topology and configure the following in all switches:
1) Change hostname as good practice.
2) Configure enable password.
3) Configure local username and password, with privilege 15.
4) Configure vty line to accept local login and transport mode set to all.
5) Configure VLAN 1 IP addresses, make sure they are in the same subnet as the Linux docker.
6) Make sure interface is up and nodes are able to ping each other.

On the Network Automation node:
1) Enable DHCP to assign IP from NAT cloud.
2) Make sure able to ping every switch.
3) Create a file listing IP address of every switch.

Automate VLAN configuration on Network Automation node:
1) Run the script conf_vlan.py, and enter credentials as set earlier.
2) Enter the name of file (myswitches) to retrieve switch IP list.

Retrieving config and write output to file on Network Automation node:
1) Run the script save_output.py.
2) Check that multiple files containing each switch's configuration are created in directory.
