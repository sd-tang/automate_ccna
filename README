This folder contains my effort at automating my CCNA labs. It will start with
basic scripting on simpler topology while slowly moving towards modern automation
techniques utilizing APIs.

My main source of lab topology and scripting comes from:
1) CCNA course - David Bombal
2) GNS3a course - David Bombal
3) Network Programmability and Automation - O'Reilly
4) DEVASC 200-901 OCG - CiscoPress
5) CCNA 200-301 OCG - CiscoPress
